# MyPL

MyPL is a minimal interpreted programming language built in pure Python. It's designed for learning purposes â€” to help understand how programming languages work at a basic level.

## Example

let x = 2 + 2 * 2;
print(x);  // Output: 6

## Usage

Run a MyPL program with:

```bash
python3 MyPL.py --run examples/hello_world.mypl

Make sure you're using Python 3.7+.
